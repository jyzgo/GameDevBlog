#About this Blog

Hi,My name is Eason Jiang,  I used be a game designer , and for now I'm a cocos2dx game developer 


Rencently, I'm interseting in Unity 3D,because I believe it's a more proficent technology than Cocos2dx is.


I believe the best way to learn a tech is try to teach it to someone else. and this the reason I build this Blog.
So,talk is cheap,let's code sth.
