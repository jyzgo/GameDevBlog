#Think Unity in Cocos2d way

Let's build a cocos2d class

1.Create a class inherit CCNode
2.Add a cube sprite on it
3.Add a rotate function as member function 


Build the simlar thing in unity
1.Create an empty GameObject
2.Add a mesh filter on it 
3.Add a mesh render on it
4.change material
5.Attach a script on it, which has a rotate function

Conclusion,what the prefab is? 

It's a class,obviously,which are able to attach different component(class too) on it.
